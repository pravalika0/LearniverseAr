this site basically converts text to 3d model.We are still developing it by making the model to seem like realistic by add textures to the models.
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
